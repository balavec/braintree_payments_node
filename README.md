# Braintree Payments in Node

I used the tutorial on Braintree website: https://developers.braintreepayments.com/start/tutorial and added few tweaks of my own:
* Bootstrap 4
* jQuery
* dotenv

Don't forget to rename example.env to .env and setup the environment variables.

To install run:

```
npm install
```

And to run in browser as http://localhost:3000/

```
npm start
```
